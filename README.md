# EIP — Embedded Intelligence Package  

**Richard Haberkern**

This repository is a reference **EIP (Embedded Intelligence Package)** and it includes a Smart Pong hybrid controller for reference.

## What EIP means

**EIP = Embedded Intelligence Package**

An EIP is more than a model file. It is a deployable intelligence package that includes:

- machine-readable model contract
- formal model datasheet
- firmware integration guide
- beginner-friendly quickstart
- runtime source code
- headers
- working example project

## Relationship to MRD and EIL

- **MRD** defines the hardware  
- **EIP** delivers the intelligence package  
- **EIL** is the runtime layer that executes intelligence safely inside the system

## Repository purpose

This repository demonstrates how an EIP can be packaged in a consistent way for:

- internal use
- customer delivery
- IDE/plugin generation
- future standardization

It is designed to help engineers with limited AI background integrate an embedded model correctly and safely.

## What this repo includes

### Documentation
- `README.md`
- `docs/MODEL_DATASHEET.md`
- `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/ENGINEER_QUICKSTART.md`
- `docs/EIP_STANDARD_OVERVIEW.md`

### Machine-readable spec
- `eip/model.eil.json`

### Runtime code
- `include/smart_pong_ai.h`
- `src/smart_pong_ai.cpp`
- `src/smart_pong_model_backend.cpp`
- `src/smart_pong_persistence.cpp`

### Example code
- `examples/full_smart_pong_example.cpp`

### Build support
- `CMakeLists.txt`

## What this example does

This Smart Pong example includes the **full AI-side runtime path** and a **complete console Pong sample** for testing.

It demonstrates:

- feature construction
- model prediction API
- analytic intercept reference
- confidence-gated blending
- learning hooks
- persistence helpers
- a minimal Pong gameplay loop

## Important note

This repository includes a **complete reference example**, but it is still a **portable demo**, not a full commercial game engine.

The included example uses:

- a deterministic sample backend in place of a real TFLM/NPU model
- console output instead of graphics rendering
- simple paddle/ball physics

That is intentional. It keeps the EIP understandable, testable, and easy to modify.

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Run:

```bash
./smart_pong_demo
```

## Why this matters

Most embedded AI efforts stop at a model artifact.

EIP packages go further by shipping:

- the model contract
- the runtime expectations
- the safe usage rules
- the code needed to integrate and test

That is what makes embedded intelligence reusable and scalable.
